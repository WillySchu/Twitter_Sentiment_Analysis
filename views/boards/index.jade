    p only save boards go on this page, we may need to make a new page for boards that are created by users not logged in.  if we do this will the user have a chance to log in afterwards and save the same project or must they be logged in prior to the search to keep the specific board saved?
    br
    p We also need to write some JS to make new boards generate automatically and to the top of the page / link with other projects if they are just versions of the same board
