# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A web application that pulls tweets based on a user's hashtag search query. The tweets are given a score based on our sentiment analysis algorithm, and are visualized in charts. The user can hover over each node in the chart to read the tweet. The user can then save that search in a board to revisit later. The user can register in the application or with GitHub OAuth.
